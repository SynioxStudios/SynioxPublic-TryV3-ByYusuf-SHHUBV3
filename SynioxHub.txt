--- 🤡 LMAFO YOU REALLY BİG NİGGA / SKİD KİD 🤡 ---

Listen up, you "Ctrl+C + Ctrl+V" professionals.

Changing the 'author' name in a script doesn't make you a developer; it just makes you a pathetic digital parasite. Your entire "coding career" is built on someone else's hard work, and your brain's processing power is clearly lower than the scripts you’re stealing.

Here’s a quick reality check for you:
1. Being a "Coder" requires a brain, not just a functioning 'V' key.
2. If the original owner deletes their repository, your entire personality disappears.
3. You’re not "sharing" scripts; you’re just showing everyone how incapable you are of creating anything original.

Imagine being so talentless that your only contribution to the community is changing a 'print' statement and acting like a genius. If you ever get a 'Syntax Error', you’ll spend 3 days crying because you don't even know what a variable is.

Keep being a fanboy while pretending to be a pro. We all see through your pathetic attempts. You’re not a developer; you’re just a script-collecting janitor.

Stay mad, stay talentless, and most importantly... stay a skid. ✌️🗑️
